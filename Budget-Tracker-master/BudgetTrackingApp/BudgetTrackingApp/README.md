# Budget Tracking App

**\* I'm still working on this project! \***

## Overview
The **Budget Tracking App** is a .NET MAUI application designed to help users track their spending and predict their financial status for the rest of the month. By leveraging machine learning, the app will analyze user transactions and determine whether they are likely to stay within their user-defined budget.

## Features
- **Spending Tracker**: Manually input and track your transactions.
- **Budget Monitoring**: Set a monthly budget and monitor your progress.
- **Machine Learning Predictions**: Predict future spending for the rest of the month based on past transactions.
- **Budget Alerts**: Notify users if they are likely to exceed their budget.

## Technology Stack
- **.NET MAUI**: Cross-platform framework for building the app.
- **C# 13.0**: Programming language used for development.
- **.NET 9**: Target framework for the application.
- **Machine Learning**: (Planned) To predict future spending patterns.
- **Manually Inputted Database**: Used to store and analyze user transactions.

## Potential Updates
- Integration with external APIs for automatic transaction imports (e.g., bank APIs).
- Enhanced machine learning models for more accurate predictions.
- Cross-platform support for iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS.
- Visualizations for spending trends and budget analysis.
- Multi-user support with secure authentication.
